    "reasoning": "The document contains a patient's history, current medications, review of systems, physical exam, assessment and plan.  The formatting and content strongly suggest a physician's progress note.  The presence of ICD codes further reinforces this classification.  The use of medical terminology and detailed descriptions of the patient's condition and treatment plan indicate it's not a simple prescription, order, or compliance report.  The inclusion of multiple pages further supports that it is a more substantial document than a delivery ticket.\n",
