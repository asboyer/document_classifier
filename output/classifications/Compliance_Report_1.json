    "%_match": "95",
    "reasoning": "The document contains data on usage, therapy, and compliance related to a CPAP machine.  The headings, numerical data, and use of terms like \"compliance met,\" \"compliance percentage,\" \"usage days,\" \"average usage,\" and \"ahi\" are all strongly indicative of a compliance report generated by a CPAP machine's data tracking system.  The inclusion of additional details like leak rates, pressure settings, and respiratory rate further supports this classification.\n"
