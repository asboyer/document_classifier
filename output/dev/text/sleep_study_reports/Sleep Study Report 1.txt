testing type & methods

type of test: diagnostic psg

method: polysomnography was conducted on the night of 6/22/2023. the following parameters were monitored:
frontal, central and occipital eeg, electroculogram {eog}, submentalis emg, nasal and oral airflow, anterior tibialis
emg, body position and electrocardiogram. additionally, thoracic and abdominal movements were recorded by
inductance plethysmography, oxygen saturation (¢p02) was monitored using a pulse oximeter, the tracing was
scored using 30 second epochs. hypopneas were scored per aasm definition.

a central apnea was defined as a cessation of oral and nasal airflow with simultaneous cessations of respiratory
movements for at least 10 seconds (2 respiratory cycles in children),

an obstructive apnea was defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds (2 respiratory cycles in children)
in the presence of continuous respiratory movements.

hypopneas were scored per aasm definition.

brief clinical history
this patient is a 44 year old male who underwent a diagnostic polysomnogram in an effort to determine the etiology of
the patient's complaints of excessive daytime somnolence, loud snoring and frequent arousals from sleep.

sleep data:

the study began at 9:48:48 pm. the patient was monitored for a total of 449.5 minutes, out of which the patient slept
for 346.5 minutes. sleep onset occurred at 11:09:47 pm for a sleep latency of 81.0 minutes. rem latency was 106.5
minutes. wake after sleep onset (waso) was 22.0 minutes. the study ended at 5.18:25 am,

a breakdown of sleep staging reveals the following: stage n1 4.5 minutes (1% of total sleep time), n2 229.0 minutes
{66% of total sleep time), n3 35.0 minutes (10% of total sleep time), rem 78.0 minutes {23% of total sleep time.)

caveat) test date: 6/22/2023 page 2

respiratory data:
during the study, there were a total of 2 apnea events for an apnea index of 0.3/hour. 113 hypopnea events occurred

for a hypopnea index of 19.6/hour. 115 apnea and hypopnea events were observed during the analysis period as
follows: 2 obstructive apneas, 0 central apneas, 0 mixed apneas, and 113 for an apnea/hypopnea index (ahi) of
20/hour of sleep. cheyne stokes was not observed. during this time, 227 desaturations occurred during the study.
desaturations were based cn 4% or greater drop from baseline. the lowest sao2 was 65% with an average of 92%,
the minimum spoq2 value associated with a respiratory event was 65%.

snoring was moderate and associated with frequent snore arousals,
arousal statistics:
a total of 116 arousals (20. 1/hour) were observed during the analysis period as follows: 115 respiratory arousals, 0

leg movement arousals, 1 spontaneous arousals, and 0 snore arousals,

plm statistics:
there were 0 plms with 0 with related arousal
