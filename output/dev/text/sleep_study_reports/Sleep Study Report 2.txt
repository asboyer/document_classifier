at home sleep study

history: the patient has undergone diagnostic polysomnography to be evaluated for sleep apnea.

procedure in detail: the patient underwent overnight home monitoring that included a continuous recording of
airflow, respiratory effort, sleep time, heart rate and oximetry. apnea events were identified as a 10 or more second
period of at least 80% reduced airflow, hypopneas events were identified as a 10 or more second period of at least
30% reduced airflow and a4 or more % drop in oxygen saturation. obstructive apnea events show an effart to
breathe; central events shaw no effort to breathe,

study overview: the study was performed on 4/3/2023. the recording was started at 14:10 pm and ended at 7:17
am for a total recording duration of 8 hours and 7 minutes. total sleep time was 2h 57 min.

respiratory event summary: the patient had 4 apneas, there are 4 obstructive, 0 unclassified, 0 central and 0
mixed apneas; and 57 hypopneas for a combined apnea-hypopnea index (ahi) of 20.7 respiratory events per hour.
there were 1799 snoring events recorded.

oxygenation: the patient's average oxygen saturation was 91, and the lowest saturation was 81%. there
were 36.03 minutes (20.4%) below 90% saturation. there were 2,18 minutes (1.2%) below 85% saturation.

pulse rate: the patient had a minimum heart rate of 46 beats/minute, a maximum heart rate of 77 beats/minute;
and an average heart rate of 61 beats/minute,

overall impression: moderate obstructive sleep apnea (g47.33).

recommendation; the patient will benefit from treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. autopap/cpap/bipap
therapy is generally the most effective form of therapy and {s suggested in this case, there are other therapeutic
options including mandibular advancement devices, and surgical procedures, and these would have to be discussed
in detail before their application.

consider initiating treatment with automatic positive airway pressure (auto-pap) with heated humidification,

pressure between 4 to 20 cmh20, and mask of the patient's choice. compliance card analysis for the compliance and
adequacy of autopap/cpap treatment is warranted in 4-6 weeks.

i. advise the patient to exercise caution while driving a motor vehicle at all times.

2. avoid evening sedatives, hypnotics and alcohol before going to bed.
3. maintenance of ideal weight recommended.
4, ifan overnight stay in the hospital is required, patient shauld use thelr apap/cpap machine.

5, if patient ever requires surgery, patient should inform their anesthesiologist about their diagnosis of sleep
apnea.

6. alternatives ta pap therapy, which include: ent evaluation, mandibular advancement device in the event

af pap nen-compliance/failure, weight loss, or airway enlargement procedures in cases of maxillofacial
skeletal deformity, should be discussed with the patient,
