care check-in

no available data because the user declined to answer the therapy questions, this feature was
turned off on the userâ€™s machine or the user did not consent to share their data with myair.

about care check-in

short patient surveys are conducted on the airsense 11 and myair app to better understand how
the patient is doing with therapy. if the patient consents, we can share care check-in information
through airview for clinical users.

questions and answers
at the beginning of therapy, the patient is asked a baseline question. a few additional questions are
asked, about once per week, during the early stages of therapy. for example:

how sleepy did you feel this week? extremely, very, moderately, slightly, not at all.
how is your therapy? great, ok, challenging.
what bothers you most? getting used to therapy, fitting the mask, using the machine.
