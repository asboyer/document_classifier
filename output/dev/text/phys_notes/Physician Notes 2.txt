somewhat of a limited study given short duration of monitoring time he had did reveal an ahi
index of 16 suggesting moderate obstructive sleep apnea associated with mild snoring.

assessment/plan:

1. osa (obstructive sleep apnea) home sleep test

2. atrial fibrillation, unspecified type
(cms/hcc)

3. congestive heart failure, unspecified hf
chronicity, unspecified heart failure type
(cms/hcc)

4. acc/aha stage c heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (cms/hcc)

5. hypothyroidism, unspecified type

the patient will more than likely benefit from cpap therapy however, | have recommended that
she repeat home sleep study and have recommended a 2 night home sleep study and follow-up
in the cpap clinic for review,

patient was counseled regarding sleep apnea and potential cardiovascular complications
weight loss would be beneficial and the patient should avoid the supine position while sleeping
alcohol and other sedatives should be avoided at night

avoid driving if excessively sleepy

follow-up in the cpap clinic for review of repeat sleep study once completed after which more
than likely cpap therapy will be initiated and will follow-up in the cpap clinic for mask fitting.

| have discussed at length the plan of care and differential diagnosis with the patient and/or the
patient's family. the patient and/or the patient's family was given time to ask questions and
