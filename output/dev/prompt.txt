testing type & methods

type of test: diagnostic psg

method: polysomnography was conducted on the night of 6/22/2023. the following parameters were monitored:
frontal, central and occipital eeg, electroculogram {eog}, submentalis emg, nasal and oral airflow, anterior tibialis
emg, body position and electrocardiogram. additionally, thoracic and abdominal movements were recorded by
inductance plethysmography, oxygen saturation (¢p02) was monitored using a pulse oximeter, the tracing was
scored using 30 second epochs. hypopneas were scored per aasm definition.

a central apnea was defined as a cessation of oral and nasal airflow with simultaneous cessations of respiratory
movements for at least 10 seconds (2 respiratory cycles in children),

an obstructive apnea was defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds (2 respiratory cycles in children)
in the presence of continuous respiratory movements.

hypopneas were scored per aasm definition.

brief clinical history
this patient is a 44 year old male who underwent a diagnostic polysomnogram in an effort to determine the etiology of
the patient's complaints of excessive daytime somnolence, loud snoring and frequent arousals from sleep.

sleep data:

the study began at 9:48:48 pm. the patient was monitored for a total of 449.5 minutes, out of which the patient slept
for 346.5 minutes. sleep onset occurred at 11:09:47 pm for a sleep latency of 81.0 minutes. rem latency was 106.5
minutes. wake after sleep onset (waso) was 22.0 minutes. the study ended at 5.18:25 am,

a breakdown of sleep staging reveals the following: stage n1 4.5 minutes (1% of total sleep time), n2 229.0 minutes
{66% of total sleep time), n3 35.0 minutes (10% of total sleep time), rem 78.0 minutes {23% of total sleep time.)

caveat) test date: 6/22/2023 page 2

respiratory data:
during the study, there were a total of 2 apnea events for an apnea index of 0.3/hour. 113 hypopnea events occurred

for a hypopnea index of 19.6/hour. 115 apnea and hypopnea events were observed during the analysis period as
follows: 2 obstructive apneas, 0 central apneas, 0 mixed apneas, and 113 for an apnea/hypopnea index (ahi) of
20/hour of sleep. cheyne stokes was not observed. during this time, 227 desaturations occurred during the study.
desaturations were based cn 4% or greater drop from baseline. the lowest sao2 was 65% with an average of 92%,
the minimum spoq2 value associated with a respiratory event was 65%.

snoring was moderate and associated with frequent snore arousals,
arousal statistics:
a total of 116 arousals (20. 1/hour) were observed during the analysis period as follows: 115 respiratory arousals, 0

leg movement arousals, 1 spontaneous arousals, and 0 snore arousals,

severe obstructive sleep apnea

1, treatment options for patients with obstructive sleep apnea include positive airway pressure which remains the gold
standard for treatment of osa, further options may include: a mandibular advancing device, surgical interventions
including a hypoglosgal nerve stimulator implant and weight logs in combination with the above treatment strategies.
2. general recommendations for patients with obstructive sleep apnea include: avoiding drowsy driving, avoiding
occupational hazards, counseling patients on the impact of sedating medications, anesthesia and alcohol in patients
with osa and maintaining a haaithy waight/avoiding waight gain. ganeral slaap tips include obtaining 7-9 hours of
sleep in every 24-hour period for adults.

at home sleep study

history: the patient has undergone diagnostic polysomnography to be evaluated for sleep apnea.

procedure in detail: the patient underwent overnight home monitoring that included a continuous recording of
airflow, respiratory effort, sleep time, heart rate and oximetry. apnea events were identified as a 10 or more second
period of at least 80% reduced airflow, hypopneas events were identified as a 10 or more second period of at least
30% reduced airflow and a4 or more % drop in oxygen saturation. obstructive apnea events show an effart to
breathe; central events shaw no effort to breathe,

study overview: the study was performed on 4/3/2023. the recording was started at 14:10 pm and ended at 7:17
am for a total recording duration of 8 hours and 7 minutes. total sleep time was 2h 57 min.

respiratory event summary: the patient had 4 apneas, there are 4 obstructive, 0 unclassified, 0 central and 0
mixed apneas; and 57 hypopneas for a combined apnea-hypopnea index (ahi) of 20.7 respiratory events per hour.
there were 1799 snoring events recorded.

oxygenation: the patient's average oxygen saturation was 91, and the lowest saturation was 81%. there
were 36.03 minutes (20.4%) below 90% saturation. there were 2,18 minutes (1.2%) below 85% saturation.

pulse rate: the patient had a minimum heart rate of 46 beats/minute, a maximum heart rate of 77 beats/minute;
and an average heart rate of 61 beats/minute,

overall impression: moderate obstructive sleep apnea (g47.33).

recommendation; the patient will benefit from treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. autopap/cpap/bipap
therapy is generally the most effective form of therapy and {s suggested in this case, there are other therapeutic
options including mandibular advancement devices, and surgical procedures, and these would have to be discussed
in detail before their application.

consider initiating treatment with automatic positive airway pressure (auto-pap) with heated humidification,

pressure between 4 to 20 cmh20, and mask of the patient's choice. compliance card analysis for the compliance and
adequacy of autopap/cpap treatment is warranted in 4-6 weeks.

i. advise the patient to exercise caution while driving a motor vehicle at all times.

i)

2. avoid evening sedatives, hypnotics and alcohol before going to bed.
3. maintenance of ideal weight recommended.
4, ifan overnight stay in the hospital is required, patient shauld use thelr apap/cpap machine.

5, if patient ever requires surgery, patient should inform their anesthesiologist about their diagnosis of sleep
apnea.

6. alternatives ta pap therapy, which include: ent evaluation, mandibular advancement device in the event

af pap nen-compliance/failure, weight loss, or airway enlargement procedures in cases of maxillofacial
skeletal deformity, should be discussed with the patient,

patient education: we reviewed obstructive sleep apnea and associated medical disorders.
we discussed cardiovascular risks associated with sleep disordered breathing. we reviewed
treatment options for sleep disordered breathing including pap therapy, oral appliances,
surgical intervention, and others. we reviewed the importance of pap therapy adherence. we
reviewed the impact of alcohol and drugs on sleep and osa. we discussed the risk associated
with driving, operating heavy machinery, or engaging in other activities during which falling
asleep would be hazardous. he was advised not to drive or participate in such activities if
drowsy. we discussed tne importance of informing anesthesiology prior to any intervention as
patients with osa may be at increased risk of perioperative morbidity and morbidity. we
discussed the potential impact of weight gain and weight loss on osa. the importance of good
sleep hygiene was reviewed as well as the impact of sleep deprivation.

home sleep study dated december 3, 2022 reviewed with the daughter and patient which was
somewhat of a limited study given short duration of monitoring time he had did reveal an ahi
index of 16 suggesting moderate obstructive sleep apnea associated with mild snoring.

assessment/plan:

1. osa (obstructive sleep apnea) home sleep test

2. atrial fibrillation, unspecified type
(cms/hcc)

3. congestive heart failure, unspecified hf
chronicity, unspecified heart failure type
(cms/hcc)

4. acc/aha stage c heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (cms/hcc)

5. hypothyroidism, unspecified type

the patient will more than likely benefit from cpap therapy however, | have recommended that
she repeat home sleep study and have recommended a 2 night home sleep study and follow-up
in the cpap clinic for review,

patient was counseled regarding sleep apnea and potential cardiovascular complications
weight loss would be beneficial and the patient should avoid the supine position while sleeping
alcohol and other sedatives should be avoided at night

avoid driving if excessively sleepy

follow-up in the cpap clinic for review of repeat sleep study once completed after which more
than likely cpap therapy will be initiated and will follow-up in the cpap clinic for mask fitting.

| have discussed at length the plan of care and differential diagnosis with the patient and/or the
patient's family. the patient and/or the patient's family was given time to ask questions and
raise concerns which were answered and addressed to the patient's/family's satisfaction.
